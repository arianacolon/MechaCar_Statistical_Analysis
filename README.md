The image above depicts the output from the linear regression. Vehicle_length and ground_clearance are two variables/coefficients that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values. The P-value for this model is 5.35e-11, which is incredibly less than the significance level of 0.05%. Therefore, we can reject the null and consider the slope of the linear model to not be zero. Due to the linear model having an R-squared of 0.7149 and being 71% accurate, the model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.
